I am a software engineer, currently focused on ML / AI, specifically LLM-driven agentic applications.

Most recently, I have been experimenting with agentic scaffolding [(Exo)](/exo), to see what kind of performance gains can be squeezed from economy models.

As a consultant, I rebuilt [Innocaption's](https://www.innocaption.com/) mobile app as a react native iOS, and then Android app. More recently, I have been developing LLM-powered
